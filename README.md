# ENPH-213-Rotating-Dipoles
My final project in the course

This project was self-designed and was based around creating a control system. The code uses a matrix that evolves over time with an electric field. 
The user can control different components of the system and therefore adjust the expected output. 
All information regarding the project can be found in the pdf file "213FinalProject.pdf".

To run:

Open MATLAB and click run while on the file "Project_213.m".
